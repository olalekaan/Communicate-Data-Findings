# Ford Gobike Data - Communicate Data Findings
### Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 5
## by Abdulganiyu Salaudeen

## Dataset

>Ford GoBike is the Bay Area's bike share system. Bay Area Bike Share was introduced in 2013 as a pilot program for the region, with 700 bikes and 70 stations across San Francisco and San Jose. Once expansion is complete, Ford GoBike will grow to 7,000 bikes across San Francisco, the East Bay and San Jose.

>Ford GoBike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. People use bike share to commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements and more. It's a fun, convenient and affordable way to get around.

>The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass.

### About the project

>This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, you will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset Ford GoBike System Data. I use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships.

>Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.

>Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

## Project Findings

Renting a bike from the Ford GoBike System is a fantastic (healthy and environmentally friendly) way of moving around in the city, both for enjoyment and work. 

* This project is focused on the trip start month of February base on the data used. The result shows that Trip Duration is so dependendable on th user type and the gender of the member, if its a subscriber, the trip duration is lesser than that of a customer. But, there are a lot more subscriber usage than customers overall. The riding habit/pattern varies a lot between subscribers and customers. 

* More rides occur on Thursdays for both subscribers and customers. this indicates that bike sharing system operates more during work days(Mo-Fri)

* Bike usaage is so dependendable on the age groups of the member, when the age is between 30 to 45, the usage of bike is higher than the other age groups for all the weekdays. 30 - 45 years age group carried out a total number of trips more than 1400 trips on Thursday for the month of feburary, which was the highest number of trips taken compare to other days of the week.
